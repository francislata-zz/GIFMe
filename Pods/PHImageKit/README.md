# PHImageKit(ty) ðŸ˜º

PHImageKit is simple yet powerful image downloading, caching and GIF playback framework. 

- Download an image or GIF and display it with just a single call
- Caches both in memory and in file storage
- Plays multiple GIFs simultaneously
- Eliminates delays or blocking during the first playback loop of GIFs
- Written in Swift

PHImageKit is the component that powers all the images and GIFs in the [Product Hunt iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/product-hunt-best-new-products/id904658671?mt=8) ðŸ˜»

## Installation

#### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C and swift, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like PHImageKit.

``` ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'PHImageKit'
```

Then, run the following command:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

## Usage

Replace your usage of `UIImageView` with `PHImageView`. Then simply pass your image url.

```swift
imageView.url = NSURL(string: "http://your_image_url.png")!
```

And that's it. ðŸš€

## Options

You can configure the appearance of `PHImageView`
